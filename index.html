                    <h5>Intro</h5>
                    <p>Crime in the United States has never been static. It shifts over time, varies by region, and takes on many different forms. 
                       Understanding these patterns can reveal a lot about societal changes, policies, and challenges over the decades.</p>

                    <h5>Map of Crime in the 20th Century</h5>
                    <p>In the 20th century, violent crime began rising, particularly in the latter half of the century. 
                       While the causes are debated, this era set the stage for many modern concerns about public safety.</p>

                    <p>As we moved into the 21st century, the landscape of violent crime shifted. Although overall crime rates began to decline in many areas, 
                       the burden has become more concentrated in specific regions — particularly the South.</p>

                    <h5>Crime in the State of Georgia</h5>
                    <p>Zooming in on Georgia, the state has seen a moderate decline in violent crime since its 20th-century peak — 
                       reflecting a broader national trend, but with its own distinct story.</p>

                    <h5>Georgia Crime Scatterplot</h5>
                    <p>This scatterplot visualizes Georgia’s crime data across time, broken down by category: homicide, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. 
                       Each dot represents the rate of a specific violent crime in a given year.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/what-caused-crime-decline" target="_blank">According to the Brennan Center,</a>
                       the significant drop in violent crime during the mid-1990s was influenced by a combination of factors, including an increase in law enforcement,
                       expanded prison populations, the waning of the crack epidemic, and even the legalization of abortion.</p>

                    <h5>Aggravated Assault</h5>
                    <p>Among all violent crimes, aggravated assault stands out as the most common in Georgia. 
                       This pattern has remained consistent across decades and highlights ongoing issues around interpersonal violence.</p>

                    <h5>Robbery</h5>
                    <p>Robbery ranks as the second most prevalent violent crime. 
                       While its rates have fluctuated, it continues to make up a significant portion of Georgia’s crime profile.</p>
